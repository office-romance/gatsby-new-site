<h4>Reinventing the Greenhouse</h4>

<p>The modern glass greenhouse requires massive inputs of energy to grow crops out of season. That&#39;s because each square metre of glass, even if it&#39;s triple glazed, loses ten times as much heat as a wall. However, growing fruits and vegetables out of season can also happen in a sustainable way, using the energy from the sun.</p>

<h4>Fermentools Lactofermentation Starter Kit Review -</h4>

<p>​Lactofermentation, for those of you not familiar with the term, is a method of food preservation that involves &quot;pickling&quot; vegetables using lactobacillis bacteria in an anarobic (oxygen free) environment. The basic process involves submerging vegetables in a salt solution to prevent the growth of competing bacteria until lactobacillis can take over and dominate the environment.</p>

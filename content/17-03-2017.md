# I am working on the development of a food company. The project is focused on the community that food creates, promoting good agricultural practices, and reducing food waste. Superpotent is a response to the wellness industries exclusivity. Instead I aim to help people fulfill nutrient requirements through wholesome, and local food.

## Work is all my own:

### Brand architecture
### Content
### Information architecture

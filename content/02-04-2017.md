# This project is a way for me to tease out architecture, design and planning's more critical roles in developing futures and imagining new possibilities. It is a podcast and platform for sharing these findings as well as connecting to resources for building community. Infiniteplaces is an internet-in-common resource and ongoing open building project. I look for collaborators, so please reach out if interested.
